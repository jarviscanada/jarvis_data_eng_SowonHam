# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate of University of Toronto - St. George Campus and I studied statistics and mathematics in my degree. Due to my passion in the DA/BA/BSA field I pursued to a profession that suits my strength and my likings. Jarvis Consulting Group is the first place that I was able to thorougly communicate with and resulted in a very positive manner to work here as one of the employee. It is such an honor to be working in a field that is continuously growing every day and see everyone including myself studying new subjects every day. Particularly, while I was studying in my field the process of gathering data, building statistical models, and analyzing through mathematical methods fascinated me to a great extent. I wish to pursue in this field to continuously learn and apply old and new methods of data analysis to play with data.
