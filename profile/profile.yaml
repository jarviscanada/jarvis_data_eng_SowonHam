# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate of University of Toronto - St. George Campus and I studied statistics and mathematics in my degree. Due to my passion in the DA/BA/BSA field I pursued to a profession that suits my strength and my likings. Jarvis Consulting Group is the first place that I was able to thorougly communicate with and resulted in a very positive manner to work here as one of the employee. It is such an honor to be working in a field that is continuously growing every day and see everyone including myself studying new subjects every day. Particularly, while I was studying in my field the process of gathering data, building statistical models, and analyzing through mathematical methods fascinated me to a great extent. I wish to pursue in this field to continuously learn and apply old and new methods of data analysis to play with data.

    description:
      - Provided the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for recording the hardware specifications and resource usage for nodes."
      - Developed bash scripts for automatically collecting the hardware specifications and resource usage from nodes and record it in a RDBMS, PostgreSQL.
      - Used docker to create a container for PostgreSQL to create/start/stop the database.
      - Queried the database to perform and collect specific data for related business questions of interest.
      - Utilized CRONTAB to automatically data every 1 minute interval from all the servers.

  - name: "Computer Automation"
    description: "\n - Implemented a complex and lengthy set of instruction for the computer to perform using Windows API as a base to diminish labour. \n
      - Researched and incorporated image and pixel searching tools to precisely determine which stage of instructions the computer is performing to reduce automation time by 30%.\n
      - Constructed separate executable for different stages of the automation to cut down the testing time and cost by a significant amount."

    description: "This project based on the computer automation that I performed on the above project.\n
      - Designed and performed a replicated exponential factorial experiment to abolish the ambiguity and precisely determine the efficiency of two contrasting scripts.\n
      - Enhanced the computer automation efficiency by 10% through utilizing the statistical conclusions written from the experiment."
  - name: "Non-linear Regression Model with a Neural Network"
    git_url:
    description: "\n - Implemented a fully-connected neural network (multi-layer perceptron) with 10-dimensional hidden layer with a trigonometric non-linearity.\n
      - Performed gradient-descent using automatic differentiation to estimate parameters given the batch-size, model variance and learning rate.\n
      - Adjusted and improved the neural network to learn both the mean and variance of the Gaussian model."
