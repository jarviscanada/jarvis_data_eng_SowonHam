# Introduction
- Describe the business context of this project (please do not copy-paste text from the project kick-off ticket)
- Also, describe how LGS would use your analytic result (hint: see kick-off ticket)
- Describe your work and technologies used (e.g. Jupyter Notebook, Python libraries, data analytics, data warehouse, etc.)

We are going to be building a Proof of Concept (POC) project for the London Gift Shop
(LGS) company to assist them with potentially increasing their revenue by utilizing 
the most recent and advanced data analysis technologies. As the LGS e-commerce company
has not been noticing any significant revenue increase in the recent years we will be
performing the following analysis. This includes but is not limited to, finding out their monthly placed and cancelled orders, sales growth, actively users,
etc. This will be delivered and utilized by the LGS marketing team to find out about
their customer behaviours and develop targeted marking campaigns (e.g. email, events,
target promotions, etc...) to attract new and existing users accordingly.

Throughout the POC project we will be delivering the final results and data analysis on 
Jupyter Notebook that displays various charts and diagrams. The data analysis will be
done through various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc. and we will
be using SQL alchemy library to connect our data warehouse PostgreSQL to Jupyter
Notebook to work with data frames using Pandas instead.

The network was created and connected between Jupyter Notebook and PostgreSQL through
Docker commands on bash by using our Jarvis containers of each software. The communication method
of all implementations or any updates regarding the project will be done through Git and GitHub.


# Implementation
## Project Architecture
- Describe the architecture of this project, including the LGS web app.
- Draw an architecture Diagram (please do not copy-paste any diagram from the project board)

## Data Analytics and Wrangling
- Create a link that points to your Jupyter notebook (use the relative path `./retail_data_analytics_wrangling.ipynb`)
- Discuss how would you use the data to help LGS to increase their revenue (e.g. design a new marketing strategy with data you provided)

# Improvements
- List three improvements that you want to do if you got more time
