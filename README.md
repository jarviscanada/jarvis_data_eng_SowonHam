# Sowon Ham . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate of University of Toronto - St. George Campus and I studied statistics and mathematics in my degree. Due to my passion in the DA/BA/BSA field I pursued to a profession that suits my strength and my likings. Jarvis Consulting Group is the first place that I was able to thorougly communicate with and resulted in a very positive manner to work here as one of the employee. It is such an honor to be working in a field that is continuously growing every day and see everyone including myself studying new subjects every day. Particularly, while I was studying in my field the process of gathering data, building statistical models, and analyzing through mathematical methods fascinated me to a great extent. I wish to pursue in this field to continuously learn and apply old and new methods of data analysis to play with data.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo/tree/master/linux_sql)]:
      
  - Provided the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for recording the hardware specifications and resource usage for nodes."
  - Developed bash scripts for automatically collecting the hardware specifications and resource usage from nodes and record it in a RDBMS, PostgreSQL.
  - Used docker to create a container for PostgreSQL to create/start/stop the database.
  - Queried the database to perform and collect specific data for related business questions of interest.
  - Utilized CRONTAB to automatically data every 1 minute interval from all the servers.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: In Progress

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo/tree/master/hadoop)]: Not Started

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo/tree/master/spark)]: Not Started


## Highlighted Projects
**Computer Automation**: 
 - Implemented a complex and lengthy set of instruction for the computer to perform using Windows API as a base to diminish labour. 
 - Researched and incorporated image and pixel searching tools to precisely determine which stage of instructions the computer is performing to reduce automation time by 30%.
 - Constructed separate executable for different stages of the automation to cut down the testing time and cost by a significant amount.

**Data Analysis on Computer Automation**: This project based on the computer automation that I performed on the above project.
 - Designed and performed a replicated exponential factorial experiment to abolish the ambiguity and precisely determine the efficiency of two contrasting scripts.
 - Enhanced the computer automation efficiency by 10% through utilizing the statistical conclusions written from the experiment.

**Non-linear Regression Model with a Neural Network**: 
 - Implemented a fully-connected neural network (multi-layer perceptron) with 10-dimensional hidden layer with a trigonometric non-linearity.
 - Performed gradient-descent using automatic differentiation to estimate parameters given the batch-size, model variance and learning rate.
 - Adjusted and improved the neural network to learn both the mean and variance of the Gaussian model.


## Professional Experiences

**Data Analyst Consultant, Jarvis Consulting Group (2021.12-Present)**: 
 - Provided the Jarvis LCA team with a MVP that collects hardware specification and resource usage on nodes using Bash scripting and store the data into a RDBMS, PostgreSQL.
 - Query the database several times to answer business related questions and observe the data.
 - Collaborated with teams to solve problems that were rather not trivial.

**Volunteer Work, St. Paschal Baylon Church (2016.05-2016.09)**: 
 - Enthusiastic to learn new methods to quickly incorporate it into the working environment.
 - Immensely communicated with other crew members to work efficiently and not overlap cleaning the same areas. - Flexible with abrupt changes in work schedule to accommodate and prepare for any uprising matters.
