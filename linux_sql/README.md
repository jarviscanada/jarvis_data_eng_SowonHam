# Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent
This project is under development. Since this project follows the itFlow, the final work will be merged to the master branch after Team Code Team.

## Architecture
Draw a cluster diagram with three Linux hosts, a DB, and agents (use draw.io website). Image must be saved to the `assets` directory.
